# brainstorm

a game set in the office world, filled with politics, factions, evil bosses, backstabbing colleagues, management consultants, leeches who don't do anything, but collect large paychecks, nepotism, inexperienced mba's that think they know how to run a company, executives that have no idea what they're doing, fanatical executives, and corporate acquisitions that turn everything upside down.

players will need to navigate to find the right company, the
right role, and the right team to succeed.

this will be part role playing where players start with random
stats and gain experience, skills, change roles, take on teams, build alliances, work on projects, fight evil bosses, and build an empire.
